# Design Document: Repository Automation & Guardrails

**Issue**: #28  
**Owner**: Cascade AI  
**Date**: August 12, 2025  

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation of comprehensive repository automation and guardrails for Ashley Calendar AI to supercharge developer productivity while maintaining code quality standards. The solution enforces a design-first development loop with automated branch creation, PR orchestration, and quality gates.

## Problem & Goals

### Current State
- Manual branch creation and PR management creates overhead
- Inconsistent development workflow across features
- No enforced design-first approach
- Limited quality guardrails for code changes
- Risk of technical debt accumulation

### Goals
1. **Automate repetitive workflow tasks** (branch creation, PR opening)
2. **Enforce design-first development** (RFC ‚Üí Test Plan ‚Üí Implementation)
3. **Implement quality guardrails** (tests required, code reviews, CI/CD)
4. **Standardize development process** across all features
5. **Scale development workflow** for future team growth

## Impact Analysis

### üöÄ Productivity Benefits
- **Automated workflow orchestration**: Auto-creates feature branches, opens design/test PRs, eliminating manual setup
- **Design-first enforcement**: Forces RFC ‚Üí Test Plan ‚Üí Implementation flow, preventing rushed code
- **Reduced context switching**: Developers focus on coding while automation handles process overhead
- **Consistent labeling and organization**: Standardized labels and templates improve issue tracking

### üõ°Ô∏è Quality Guardrails
- **Test-driven development**: Implementation PRs blocked without tests or approved test plans
- **Code review enforcement**: CODEOWNERS + required reviews ensure quality gates
- **CI/CD integration**: Automated linting, typechecking, and testing on every PR
- **Branch protection**: Prevents direct commits to main, enforces linear history

### üìà Long-term Benefits
- **Scalable process**: Works for solo development now, scales as team grows
- **Documentation culture**: RFC/Test Plan templates ensure design decisions are captured
- **Reduced technical debt**: Quality gates prevent shortcuts that create future problems
- **Knowledge preservation**: Design decisions and rationale documented in RFCs
- **Faster onboarding**: New developers follow established patterns and templates
- **Improved code quality**: Consistent review process and automated checks
- **Better project visibility**: Clear labeling and organization of work streams

## Design Proposal

### Workflow Architecture
```
Issue Created ‚Üí Auto Branch ‚Üí RFC PR ‚Üí Test Plan PR ‚Üí Implementation PR ‚Üí Merge
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì           ‚Üì           ‚Üì              ‚Üì            ‚Üì
  ready:design   feature/N-   Design    Test Plan    Code + Tests   Deploy
    label        title-slug   Review     Review       + CI Checks
```

### Core Components

#### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows
- **Auto Branch Creation**: Triggers on issue open or `ready:design` label
- **RFC PR Automation**: Opens design PR when RFC pushed to feature branch
- **Test Plan PR Automation**: Opens test plan PR when test plan pushed
- **CI Pipeline**: Lint, typecheck, unit tests, optional e2e tests
- **Implementation Guard**: Blocks implementation PRs without tests or approved test plans

#### 2. Quality Gates
- **CODEOWNERS**: Ensures proper code review for critical paths
- **Branch Protection**: Requires PR reviews, status checks, linear history
- **Test Requirements**: Implementation changes must include tests or reference approved test plan

#### 3. Templates & Standards
- **RFC Template**: Structured design documentation
- **Test Plan Template**: Comprehensive testing strategy
- **PR Template**: Consistent pull request format
- **Issue Labels**: Standardized categorization system

### Ashley-Specific Considerations
- **BAML Models**: Special handling for AI model changes
- **Voice Integration**: Siri/speech-specific testing requirements  
- **n8n Workflows**: Integration testing for workflow changes
- **Multi-participant Features**: Complex scheduling logic validation

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
- Create directory structure
- Add GitHub Actions workflows
- Implement guard scripts
- Set up templates

### Phase 2: Protection & Standards
- Configure CODEOWNERS
- Enable branch protection
- Create standardized labels
- Add PR templates

### Phase 3: Verification & Rollout
- Test automation workflows
- Verify guard functionality
- Document process for team
- Create kickoff templates

## Success Metrics

### Immediate (Week 1-2)
- [ ] All workflows executing successfully
- [ ] Branch protection active on main
- [ ] Templates being used for new features

### Short-term (Month 1)
- [ ] 100% of new features follow RFC ‚Üí Test Plan ‚Üí Implementation flow
- [ ] Zero direct commits to main branch
- [ ] All implementation PRs include tests or approved test plans

### Long-term (Month 3+)
- [ ] Reduced time from feature idea to implementation
- [ ] Improved code review quality and consistency
- [ ] Better documentation of design decisions
- [ ] Fewer production bugs due to quality gates

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Developer Friction
- **Mitigation**: Clear documentation, templates, and gradual rollout
- **Fallback**: Ability to bypass guards with admin approval for emergencies

### Risk: Automation Failures
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing of workflows before rollout
- **Fallback**: Manual process documentation as backup

### Risk: Over-Engineering
- **Mitigation**: Start with core workflows, add complexity incrementally
- **Monitoring**: Regular review of process effectiveness

## Future Enhancements

See Issue #[TBD] for incremental improvements including:
- Enhanced branch naming with length limits
- Ashley-specific test pattern recognition
- Domain-specific labels (BAML, voice, n8n)
- Deployment automation
- GitHub issue templates

## Conclusion

This automation setup will transform Ashley Calendar AI's development workflow from manual and inconsistent to automated and standardized. The design-first approach ensures quality while automation eliminates overhead, creating a scalable foundation for future growth.

The implementation directly addresses current pain points while establishing practices that will serve the project well as it evolves and potentially grows to include additional team members.
