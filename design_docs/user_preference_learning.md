# User Preference Learning

## Current State
Ashley Calendar AI currently treats each meeting request independently without learning from user patterns or preferences over time.

## Enhancement
Implement machine learning capabilities to identify and apply user preferences automatically, improving scheduling efficiency and user experience.

## Requirements
- **Pattern Recognition**: Analyze historical meeting data to identify user preferences
- **Preference Categories**:
  - Preferred meeting times (morning vs afternoon)
  - Default meeting durations (30 min vs 1 hour)
  - Room/location preferences for different meeting types
  - Advance notice preferences for calendar invites
  - Recurring meeting patterns
  - Buffer time preferences between meetings
- **Smart Suggestions**: Apply learned preferences to new meeting requests
- **User Confirmation**: Always confirm assumptions with users before applying preferences
- **Preference Override**: Allow users to easily override suggested preferences

## Implementation Options

### Phase 1: Basic Pattern Recognition
- Analyze meeting history from calendar data
- Identify simple patterns (time preferences, duration preferences)
- Store preferences in user profile database
- Apply preferences as suggestions (not automatic)

### Phase 2: Advanced Learning
- Machine learning model to identify complex patterns
- Context-aware preferences (different preferences for different meeting types)
- Seasonal/temporal pattern recognition
- Integration with external calendar analytics

### Phase 3: Predictive Scheduling
- Predict optimal meeting times based on all participants' preferences
- Suggest meeting types based on participants and context
- Proactive scheduling suggestions

## Technical Considerations

### Data Requirements
- Historical calendar data (minimum 30 days for basic patterns)
- Meeting metadata (duration, participants, type, outcome)
- User feedback on suggestions (accept/reject/modify)

### Privacy & Security
- User consent for preference learning
- Data anonymization options
- Ability to disable learning features
- Clear data retention policies

### Performance
- Lightweight preference storage
- Fast pattern matching algorithms
- Minimal impact on response times

## Benefits
- **Improved Efficiency**: Faster meeting scheduling with fewer back-and-forth emails
- **Better User Experience**: Personalized suggestions that match user habits
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Users don't need to specify preferences repeatedly
- **Smarter Scheduling**: System learns what works best for each user
- **Scalability**: Preferences improve automatically over time

## Success Metrics
- Reduction in scheduling iterations per meeting
- User acceptance rate of suggested preferences
- Time saved in meeting scheduling process
- User satisfaction scores

## Dependencies
- Context Memory system (Issue #7) for storing historical data
- User profile database for preference storage
- Calendar integration for historical data access

## Labels
enhancement, machine-learning, user-experience, preferences

## Priority
Medium - This is a valuable enhancement but not critical for core functionality

## Estimated Effort
- Phase 1: 2-3 weeks
- Phase 2: 4-6 weeks  
- Phase 3: 6-8 weeks

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Time Preference Learning
```
Historical Pattern:
- User schedules 80% of meetings between 9-11 AM
- Rarely schedules meetings after 4 PM
- Never schedules meetings during lunch (12-1 PM)

New Request: "Schedule a team meeting next week"
Smart Suggestion: "Based on your preferences, I suggest Tuesday at 10 AM. Does this work for you?"
```

### Scenario 2: Duration Preference Learning
```
Historical Pattern:
- 1:1 meetings are typically 30 minutes
- Team meetings are typically 1 hour
- Client meetings are typically 45 minutes

New Request: "Set up a 1:1 with Sarah"
Smart Suggestion: "I'll schedule a 30-minute 1:1 with Sarah based on your usual preference. Let me know if you need more time."
```

### Scenario 3: Room Preference Learning
```
Historical Pattern:
- Small team meetings (2-4 people) → Conference Room A
- Large team meetings (5+ people) → Conference Room B
- Client meetings → Executive Conference Room

New Request: "Schedule a meeting with the 6-person engineering team"
Smart Suggestion: "I'll book Conference Room B for your engineering team meeting, as it's your preferred room for larger team meetings."
```
