🚀 Meet Ashley: My Calendar & Coordination Copilot
Over the last week, I built something I’ve always wanted — a reliable assistant that helps manage scheduling, meetings, and coordination without constant babysitting.

Meet Ashley — a smart, structured, and context-aware calendar assistant that handles the messy parts of scheduling so I don’t have to.

❓Have you ever had to… 
- Respond to five different “Are you free at X time tomorrow?” messages — manually?
- Scramble to find time slots that work across multiple people?
- Spot calendar collisions after you’ve already committed to two meetings at the same time?
- Juggle conflicting meeting requests and figure out which one takes priority?
- Rewrite meeting invites because the agenda changed… again?

Ashley takes care of all that — quietly and correctly — like a great EA would.

✅ What makes Ashley different?
Speedy — Ashley checks email and takes actions every 5 minutes, unlike lazy old me
Reliable — Ashley reads through long email threads to get the essence of meeting requests, saving me the hassle
Polite — Despite multiple back-n-forth attempts to co-ordinate calendars, Ashley maintains composure and politeness. No more single liners from me. 
Learning — Ashley is built with RLHF allowing weekly learning and improvement. I'd like to say I learn at the same pace, but with calendaring .....
Reliable outputs — Every AI action is tested and versioned using BAML

🧠 Ashley isn’t going rogue — human in the loop by design
Every action that Ashley suggests taking gets recorded in an Airtable table awaiting human (me) correction and approval before action.
Human judgment always takes precedence. And every instance of human correction is a future test case and RLHF opportunity. Isn't that what growth mindset is all about?

🛠️ Built with:
- n8n for event-driven orchestration
- BAML for LLM reliability
- Claude Sonnet for language and calendar logic
- Airtable for HITL (human in the loop)
- Gmail, Google Calendar
- Lots of conversations with ChatGPT
- Test Driven Development using Cursor Agent
