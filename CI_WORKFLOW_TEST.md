# CI Workflow Test

This is a dummy file created to test that the CI workflow triggers correctly on pull requests to master.

## Purpose
- Verify CI workflow runs on PRs to master
- Confirm all build steps execute successfully
- Test that the Issue #37 branch merge didn't break CI functionality

## Expected Behavior
When this PR is created, the CI workflow should:
1. ✅ Trigger automatically
2. ✅ Run npm install
3. ✅ Execute linting
4. ✅ Build the project
5. ✅ Run tests

## Cleanup
This file can be deleted once CI verification is complete.
