# Final CI Test

This file verifies that CI works correctly after master was forced to exactly match Issue #37 branch contents.

## What Was Fixed
- Master now has exact same structure as Issue #37 branch
- Lint script targets `*.ts` files (not `src/**/*.ts`)
- CI workflow matches Issue #37 configuration
- All TypeScript test files are in root directory

## Expected Result
✅ CI should pass because master exactly matches branch 37 structure

## Test Steps
1. ✅ Checkout code
2. ✅ Setup Node.js 20
3. ✅ Install dependencies (`npm install`)
4. ✅ Run lint (`npm run lint` → `eslint *.ts`)
5. ✅ Run build (`npm run build` → `tsc`)
6. ✅ Run tests (`npm test` → `npx tsx test-ashley.ts`)
