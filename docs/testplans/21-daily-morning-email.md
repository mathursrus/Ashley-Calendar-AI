- Calendar API integration (assumed working)
- User authentication (assumed working)
- Mobile app integration (future enhancement)

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
- Email template rendering functions
- Conflict detection algorithms
- Schedule parsing and formatting
- Quick action URL generation

### Integration Tests
- Calendar data retrieval and processing
- Email delivery system integration
- Pending requests aggregation
- Multi-timezone handling

### End-to-End Tests
- Complete daily email generation workflow
- User interaction with quick action buttons
- Error recovery scenarios

## Test Data Requirements

### Calendar States
- **Empty Schedule**: No meetings for the day
- **Normal Schedule**: 2-4 meetings with standard details
- **Busy Schedule**: 6+ meetings with potential conflicts
- **Mixed Schedule**: Combination of confirmed, tentative, and pending meetings

### Pending Requests
- **Recent Requests**: Within last 24-48 hours
- **Overdue Requests**: Older than 3 days
- **Various Types**: New meetings, rescheduling, cancellations

### Conflict Scenarios
- **Time Conflicts**: Overlapping meeting times
- **Travel Conflicts**: Insufficient travel time between locations
- **Missing Information**: Meetings without location or attendees
- **Overdue Items**: Pending requests requiring attention

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Test calendar with controlled data
- Mock email delivery system
- Test database with sample pending requests
- Configurable time zone settings (Pacific Time)

### Test Data Setup
- Create test calendar events for various scenarios
- Populate pending requests table with sample data
- Configure conflict detection parameters
- Set up email template test environment

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Basic Schedule Email
- **Objective:** Verify basic email generation with normal schedule
- **Preconditions:** Calendar has 2-3 standard meetings
- **Steps:** Trigger daily email generation
- **Expected Result:** Email contains formatted schedule with meeting details

### Test Case 2: Empty Schedule Handling
- **Objective:** Verify email behavior with no scheduled meetings
- **Preconditions:** Calendar is empty for the day
- **Steps:** Trigger daily email generation
- **Expected Result:** Email sent with "No meetings scheduled" message

### Test Case 3: Pending Requests Display
- **Objective:** Verify pending scheduling requests are included
- **Preconditions:** Multiple pending requests in system
- **Steps:** Trigger daily email generation
- **Expected Result:** Email includes pending requests section with details

### Test Case 4: Time Conflict Detection
- **Objective:** Verify detection of overlapping meetings
- **Preconditions:** Calendar has overlapping time slots
- **Steps:** Trigger daily email generation
- **Expected Result:** Email highlights time conflicts with recommendations

### Test Case 5: Travel Conflict Detection
- **Objective:** Verify detection of insufficient travel time
- **Preconditions:** Back-to-back meetings at different locations
- **Steps:** Trigger daily email generation
- **Expected Result:** Email flags travel conflicts with suggested adjustments

### Test Case 6: Missing Location Detection
- **Objective:** Verify detection of meetings without location
- **Preconditions:** Meetings scheduled without location information
- **Steps:** Trigger daily email generation
- **Expected Result:** Email highlights meetings needing location details

### Test Case 7: Overdue Request Detection
- **Objective:** Verify identification of overdue scheduling requests
- **Preconditions:** Pending requests older than 3 days
- **Steps:** Trigger daily email generation
- **Expected Result:** Email prioritizes overdue requests with urgency indicators

### Test Case 8: Complex Day Scenario
- **Objective:** Verify handling of day with multiple issues
- **Preconditions:** Schedule with conflicts, missing info, and overdue requests
- **Steps:** Trigger daily email generation
- **Expected Result:** Email comprehensively addresses all issues with priorities

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
